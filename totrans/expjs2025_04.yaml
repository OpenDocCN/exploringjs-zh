- en: Among programmers, JavaScript isn’t always well liked. One reason is that it
    has a fair amount of quirks. Some of them are just unusual ways of doing something.
    Others are considered bugs. Either way, learning *why* JavaScript does something
    the way it does, helps with dealing with the quirks and with accepting JavaScript
    (maybe even liking it). Hopefully, this book can help.
