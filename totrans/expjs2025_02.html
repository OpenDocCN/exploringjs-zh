  </li>
  <li>
    Test-driven exercises available for most chapters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Covers all essential features of JavaScript, up to and including ES2022.
  </li>
  <li>
    Optional advanced sections let you dig deeper.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>No prior knowledge of JavaScript is required, but you should know how to program.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    This book deliberately focuses on the language. Browser-only features, etc. are not described.
