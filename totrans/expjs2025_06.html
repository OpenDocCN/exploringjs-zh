<h3 id="how-js-was-created"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#how-js-was-created">5.1 How JavaScript was created</a></h3>
<p>JavaScript was created in May 1995 in 10 days, by Brendan Eich. Eich worked at Netscape and implemented JavaScript for their web browser, <em>Netscape Navigator</em>. <span id="index-entry-Eich--Brendan"/></p>
<p>The idea was that major interactive parts of the client-side web were to be implemented in Java. JavaScript was supposed to be a glue language for those parts and to also make HTML slightly more interactive. Given its role of assisting Java, JavaScript had to look like Java. That ruled out existing solutions such as Perl, Python, TCL, and others.</p>
<p>Initially, JavaScript’s name changed several times:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Its code name was <em>Mocha</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Netscape Navigator 2.0 betas (September 1995), it was called <em>LiveScript</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 (December 1995), it got its final name, <em>JavaScript</em>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="standardizing-javascript"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#standardizing-javascript">5.2 Standardization: JavaScript vs. ECMAScript</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-entry-ECMAScript"/><span id="index-entry-Ecma"/><span id="index-entry-ECMA-262"/></p>
<p>There are two standards for JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    ECMA-262 is hosted by Ecma International. It is the primary standard.
  </li>
  <li>
    ISO/IEC 16262 is hosted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This is a secondary standard.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The language described by these standards is called <em>ECMAScript</em>, not <em>JavaScript</em>. A different name was chosen because Sun (now Oracle) had a trademark for the latter name. The “ECMA” in “ECMAScript” comes from the organization that hosts the primary standard.</p>
<p>The original name of that organization was <em>ECMA</em>, an acronym for <em>European Computer Manufacturers Association</em>. It was later changed to <em>Ecma International</em> (with “Ecma” being a proper name, not an acronym) because the organization’s activities had expanded beyond Europe. The initial all-caps acronym explains the spelling of ECMAScript.</p>
<p><strong>Often, JavaScript and ECMAScript mean the same thing.</strong> Sometimes the following distinction is made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The term <em>JavaScript</em> refers to the language and its implementations.
  </li>
  <li>
    The term <em>ECMAScript</em> refers to the language standard and language versions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, <em>ECMAScript 6</em> is a version of the language (its 6th edition).</p>
<h3 id="ecmascript-version-timeline"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#ecmascript-version-timeline">5.3 Timeline of ECMAScript versions</a></h3>
<p>This is a brief timeline of ECMAScript versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    ECMAScript 1 (June 1997): First version of the standard.
  </li>
  <li>
    ECMAScript 2 (June 1998): Small update to keep ECMA-262 in sync with the ISO standard.
  </li>
  <li>
    ECMAScript 3 (December 1999): Adds many core features – “[…] regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements [do-while, switch], try/catch exception handling, […]”
  </li>
  <li>
    ECMAScript 4 (abandoned in July 2008): Would have been a massive upgrade (with static typing, modules, namespaces, and more), but ended up being too ambitious and dividing the language’s stewards.
  </li>
  <li>
    ECMAScript 5 (December 2009): Brought minor improvements – a few standard library features and <a href="ch_syntax.html#strict-mode"><em>strict mode</em></a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    ECMAScript 5.1 (June 2011): Another small update to keep Ecma and ISO standards in sync.
  </li>
  <li>
    ECMAScript 6 (June 2015): A large update that fulfilled many of the promises of ECMAScript 4. This version is the first one whose official name – <em>ECMAScript 2015</em> – is based on the year of publication.
  </li>
  <li>
    ECMAScript 2016 (June 2016): First yearly release. The shorter release life cycle resulted in fewer new features compared to the large ES6.
  </li>
  <li>
    ECMAScript 2017 (June 2017). Second yearly release.
  </li>
  <li>
    Subsequent ECMAScript versions (ES2018, etc.) are always ratified in June.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tc39"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#tc39">5.4 Evolving JavaScript: TC39</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-entry-TC39"/><span id="index-entry-Technical-Committee-39"/></p>
<p>TC39 (Ecma Technical Committee 39) is the committee that evolves JavaScript. Its members are, strictly speaking, companies: Adobe, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Opera, Twitter, and others. That is, companies that are usually competitors are working together on JavaScript.</p>
<p>Every two months, TC39 has meetings that member-appointed delegates and invited experts attend. The minutes of those meetings are public in <a href="https://github.com/tc39/notes">a GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of meetings, TC39 also collaborates with various members and groups of the JavaScript community.</p>
<h3 id="tc39-process"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#tc39-process">5.5 The TC39 process for proposed ECMAScript features</a></h3>
<p><span id="index-entry-TC39-process"/>
<span id="index-entry-ECMAScript-proposal"/></p>
<p>With ECMAScript 6, two issues with the release process used at that time became obvious:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If too much time passes between releases then features that are ready early, have to wait a long time until they can be released. And features that are ready late, risk being rushed to make the deadline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Features were often designed long before they were implemented and used. Design deficiencies related to implementation and use were therefore discovered too late.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In response to these issues, TC39 instituted the new <em>TC39 process</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    ECMAScript features are designed independently and go through six stages: a strawperson stage 0 and five “maturity” stages (1, 2, 2.7, 3, 4).
  </li>
  <li>
    Especially the later stages require prototype implementations and real-world testing, leading to feedback loops between designs and implementations.
  </li>
  <li>
    ECMAScript versions are released once per year and include all features that have reached stage 4 prior to a release deadline.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The result: smaller, incremental releases, whose features have already been field-tested.</p>
<p>ES2016 was the first ECMAScript version that was designed according to the TC39 process.</p>
<h4 id="tip-think-in-individual-features-and-stages-not-ecmascript-versions"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#tip-think-in-individual-features-and-stages-not-ecmascript-versions">5.5.1 Tip: Think in individual features and stages, not ECMAScript versions</a></h4>
<p>Up to and including ES6, it was most common to think about JavaScript in terms of ECMAScript versions – for example, “Does this browser support ES6 yet?”</p>
<p>Starting with ES2016, it’s better to think in individual features: once a feature reaches stage 4, we can safely use it (if it’s supported by the JavaScript engines we are targeting). We don’t have to wait until the next ECMAScript release.</p>
<h4 id="the-details-of-the-tc39-process-advanced"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#the-details-of-the-tc39-process-advanced">5.5.2 The details of the TC39 process<span> (advanced)</span></a></h4>
<p>ECMAScript features are designed via <em>proposals</em> that go through the so-called <em>TC39 process</em>. That process comprises six stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Stage 0 means a proposal has yet to enter the actual process. This is where most proposals start.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then the proposal goes through the five maturity stages 1, 2, 2.7, 3 and 4. If it reaches stage 4, it is complete and ready for inclusion in the ECMAScript standard.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="artifacts-associated-with-an-ecmascript-proposal"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#artifacts-associated-with-an-ecmascript-proposal">5.5.2.1 Artifacts associated with an ECMAScript proposal</a></h5>
<p>The following artifacts are associated with an ECMAScript proposal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proposal document:</strong> Describes the proposal to JavaScript programmers, with English prose and code examples. Usually the readme of a GitHub repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Specification:</strong> Written in <a href="https://tc39.es/ecmarkup/"><em>Ecmarkup</em></a>, an HTML and Markdown dialect that is supported by a toolchain. That toolchain checks Ecmarkup and renders it to HTML with features tailored to reading specifications (cross-references, highlighting of variable occurrences, etc.).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The HTML can also be printed to a PDF.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a proposal makes it to stage 4, its specification is integrated into the full ECMAScript specification (which is also written in Ecmarkup).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tests:</strong> Written in JavaScript that check if an implementation conforms to the specification.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a proposal makes it to stage 4, its tests are integrated into <a href="https://github.com/tc39/test262">Test262</a>, the official ECMAScript conformance test suite.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Implementations:</strong> The functionality of the proposal, implemented in engines and transpilers (such as Babel and TypeScript).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Each stage has entrance criteria regarding the state of the artifacts:</p>

<h3 id="backward-compatibility"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#backward-compatibility">5.6 How to not break the web while changing JavaScript</a></h3>
<p>One idea that occasionally comes up is to clean up JavaScript by removing old features and quirks. While the appeal of that idea is obvious, it has significant downsides.</p>
<p>Let’s assume we create a new version of JavaScript that is not backward compatible and fixes all of its flaws. As a result, we’d encounter the following problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    JavaScript engines become bloated: they need to support both the old and the new version. The same is true for tools such as IDEs and build tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    Programmers need to know, and be continually conscious of, the differences between the versions.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can either migrate all of an existing code base to the new version (which can be a lot of work). Or we can mix versions and refactoring becomes harder because we can’t move code between versions without changing it.
  </li>
  <li>
    We somehow have to specify per piece of code – be it a file or code embedded in a web page – what version it is written in. Every conceivable solution has pros and cons. For example, <a href="ch_syntax.html#strict-mode"><em>strict mode</em></a> is a slightly cleaner version of ES5. One of the reasons why it wasn’t as popular as it should have been: it was a hassle to opt in via a directive at the beginning of a file or a function.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>So what is the solution? This is how JavaScript is evolved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New versions are always completely backward compatible (but there may occasionally be minor, hardly noticeable clean-ups).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Old features aren’t removed or fixed. Instead, better versions of them are introduced. One example is declaring variables via <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> – which are improved versions of <code>var</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If aspects of the language are changed, it is done inside new syntactic constructs. That is, we opt in implicitly – for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>yield</code> is only a keyword inside generators (which were introduced in ES6).
      </li>
      <li>
        All code inside modules and classes (both introduced in ES6) is implicitly in strict mode.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h4 id="where-can-i-look-up-which-features-were-added-in-a-given-ecmascript-version"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#where-can-i-look-up-which-features-were-added-in-a-given-ecmascript-version">5.7.1 Where can I look up which features were added in a given ECMAScript version?</a></h4>
<p>There are several places where you can look up what’s new in each ECMAScript version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In this book, there is <a href="ch_new-javascript-features.html#ch_new-javascript-features">a chapter that lists what’s new in each ECMAScript version</a>. It also links to explanations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The TC39 repository has a table with <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/main/finished-proposals.md">finished proposals</a> that states in which ECMAScript versions they were (or will be) introduced.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-intro">Section “Introduction” of the ECMAScript language specification</a> lists the new features of each ECMAScript version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ECMA-262 repository has <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/releases">a page with releases</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-is-my-favorite-proposed-javascript-feature-doing"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#how-is-my-favorite-proposed-javascript-feature-doing">5.7.2 How is [my favorite proposed JavaScript feature] doing?</a></h4>
<p>If you are wondering what stages various proposed features are in, see <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals">the GitHub repository <code>proposals</code></a>.</p>
<h4 id="stage-2.7"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#stage-2.7">5.7.3 Why does stage 2.7 have such a peculiar number?</a></h4>
<p>Stage 2.7 was added in <a href="https://github.com/tc39/process-document/pull/37/commits">late 2023</a>, after stages 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 had already been in use for years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Q: Why not renumber the stages?
    <ul>
      <li>
        A: Renumbering was not in the cards because it would have made old documents difficult to read.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Q: Why not another number such as 2.5?
    <ul>
      <li>
        The .7 reflects that stage 2.7 is closer to stage 3 than to stage 2.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Q: How about 3a for the new stage and 3b for the old stage 3?
    <ul>
      <li>
        A: If you read “stage 3” in an old document, it can be confusing as to whether this refers to the new stage 3a or the new stage 3b.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
