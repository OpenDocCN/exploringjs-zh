- en: That is called the *type signature* of `Number.isFinite()`. This notation, especially
    the static types `number` of `num` and `boolean` of the result, are not real JavaScript.
    The notation is borrowed from the compile-to-JavaScript language TypeScript (which
    is mostly just JavaScript plus static typing).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why is this notation being used? It helps give you a quick idea of how a function
    works. The notation is explained in detail in [“Tackling TypeScript”](https://exploringjs.com/tackling-ts/ch_typescript-essentials.html),
    but is usually relatively intuitive.
