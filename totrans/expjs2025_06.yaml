    at Netscape and implemented JavaScript for their web browser, *Netscape Navigator*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea was that major interactive parts of the client-side web were to be
    implemented in Java. JavaScript was supposed to be a glue language for those parts
    and to also make HTML slightly more interactive. Given its role of assisting Java,
    JavaScript had to look like Java. That ruled out existing solutions such as Perl,
    Python, TCL, and others.

- en: The language described by these standards is called *ECMAScript*, not *JavaScript*.
    A different name was chosen because Sun (now Oracle) had a trademark for the latter
    name. The “ECMA” in “ECMAScript” comes from the organization that hosts the primary
    standard.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The original name of that organization was *ECMA*, an acronym for *European
    Computer Manufacturers Association*. It was later changed to *Ecma International*
    (with “Ecma” being a proper name, not an acronym) because the organization’s activities
    had expanded beyond Europe. The initial all-caps acronym explains the spelling
    of ECMAScript.
