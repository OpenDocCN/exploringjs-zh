For more information, see [the pull request for this improvement](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1585).              ### [6.6 New in ECMAScript 2020](#new-in-es2020)    *   New module features:               *   [Dynamic imports via `import()`](ch_modules.html#dynamic-imports): The normal `import` statement is static: We can only use it at the top levels of modules and its module specifier is a fixed string. `import()` changes that. It can be used anywhere (including conditional statements) and we can compute its argument.                       *   [`import.meta`](ch_modules.html#import.meta) contains metadata for the current module. Its first widely supported property is `import.meta.url` which contains a string with the URL of the current module’s file.                       *   [Namespace re-exporting](ch_modules.html#cheat-sheet-modules): The following expression imports all exports of module `'mod'` in a namespace object `ns` and exports that object.                                    ```", "```js                   *   [Optional chaining for property accesses and method calls](ch_objects.html#optional-chaining).

This operator lets us use a default value whenever something is missing.                    Previously the Logical Or operator (`||`) was used in this case but it has downsides here because it returns the default value whenever the left-hand side is falsy (which isn’t always correct).           *   [Bigints – arbitrary-precision integers](ch_bigints.html#ch_bigints): Bigint is a new primitive type. It supports integer numbers that can be arbitrarily large (storage for them grows as necessary).           *   [`String.prototype.matchAll()`](ch_regexps.html#String.prototype.matchAll): This method throws if flag `/g` isn’t set and returns an iterable with all match objects for a given string.           *   [`Promise.allSettled()`](ch_promises.html#Promise.allSettled) receives an iterable of Promises. It returns a Promise that is fulfilled once all the input Promises are settled. The fulfillment value is an Array with one object per input Promise – either one of:               *   `{ status: 'fulfilled', value: «fulfillment value» }`     *   `{ status: 'rejected', reason: «rejection value» }` *   [`globalThis`](ch_variables-assignment.html#globalThis) provides a way to access the global object that works both on browsers and server-side platforms such as Node.js and Deno.           *   `for-in` mechanics: This feature is beyond the scope of this book. For more information on it, see [its proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-for-in-order).           *   [Namespace re-exporting](ch_modules.html#re-exporting):                    ```", "```js              ### [6.7 New in ECMAScript 2019](#new-in-es2019)    *   Array method [`.flatMap()`](ch_arrays.html#Array.prototype.flatMap) works like `.map()` but lets the callback return Arrays of zero or more values instead of single values.

Use cases include:               *   Filtering and mapping at the same time     *   Mapping single input values to multiple output values *   Array method [`.flat()`](ch_arrays.html#qref-Array.prototype.flat) converts nested Arrays into flat Arrays. Optionally, we can tell it at which depth of nesting it should stop flattening.           *   [`Object.fromEntries()`](ch_objects.html#Object.fromEntries) creates an object from an iterable over *entries*.

Previously, the description was included in the result of `.toString()` but couldn’t be accessed individually.           *   `.sort()` for Arrays and Typed Arrays is now guaranteed to be *stable*: If elements are considered equal by sorting, then sorting does not change the order of those elements (relative to each other).              These ES2019 features are beyond the scope of this book:    *   JSON superset: See [2ality blog post](https://2ality.com/2019/01/json-superset.html). *   Well-formed `JSON.stringify()`: See [2ality blog post](https://2ality.com/2019/01/well-formed-stringify.html). *   `Function.prototype.toString()` revision: See [2ality blog post](https://2ality.com/2016/08/function-prototype-tostring.html).    ### [6.8 New in ECMAScript 2018](#new-in-es2018)    *   [Asynchronous iteration](ch_async-iteration.html#ch_async-iteration) is the asynchronous version of synchronous iteration.

With asynchronous iterables, we have to `await` before we can access an item.     *   With synchronous iterables, we use `for-of` loops. With asynchronous iterables, we use `for-await-of` loops. *   [Spreading into object literals](ch_objects.html#spreading-into-object-literals): By using spreading (`...`) inside an object literal, we can copy the properties of another object into the current one. One use case is to create a shallow copy of an object `obj`:                    ```", "```js           *   [Rest properties (destructuring)](ch_destructuring.html#rest-properties): When object-destructuring a value, we can now use rest syntax (`...`) to get all previously unmentioned properties in an object.                    ```", "```js           *   [`Promise.prototype.finally()`](ch_promises.html#Promise.prototype.finally) is related to the `finally` clause of a try-catch-finally statement – similarly to how the Promise method `.then()` is related to the `try` clause and `.catch()` is related to the `catch` clause.                    On other words: The callback of `.finally()` is executed regardless of whether a Promise is fulfilled or rejected.           *   New Regular expression features:               *   [`RegExp` named capture groups](ch_regexps.html#named-capture-groups): In addition to accessing groups by number, we can now name them and access them by name:                                    ```", "```js                       *   [`RegExp` lookbehind assertions](ch_regexps.html#regexp-lookbehind-assertions) complement lookahead assertions:                           *   Positive lookbehind: `(?<=X)` matches if the current location is preceded by `'X'`.         *   Negative lookbehind: `(?<!X)` matches if the current location is not preceded by `'(?<!X)'`.     *   [`s` (`dotAll`) flag for regular expressions](ch_regexps.html#regexp-dot-all-flag).
