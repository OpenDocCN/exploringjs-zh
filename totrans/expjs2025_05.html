<h3 id="influences-of-javascript"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#influences-of-javascript">4.1 JavaScript’s influences</a></h3>
<p>When JavaScript was created in 1995, it was influenced by several programming languages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    JavaScript’s syntax is largely based on Java.
  </li>
  <li>
    Self inspired JavaScript’s prototypal inheritance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Closures and environments were borrowed from Scheme.
  </li>
  <li>
    AWK influenced JavaScript’s functions (including the keyword <code>function</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    JavaScript’s strings, Arrays, and regular expressions take cues from Perl.
  </li>
  <li>
    HyperTalk inspired event handling via <code>onclick</code> in web browsers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>With ECMAScript 6, new influences came to JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Generators were borrowed from Python.
  </li>
  <li>
    The syntax of arrow functions came from CoffeeScript.
  </li>
  <li>
    C++ contributed the keyword <code>const</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Destructuring was inspired by Lisp’s <em>destructuring bind</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Template literals came from the E language (where they are called <em>quasi literals</em>).
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-javascript"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#the-nature-of-javascript">4.2 The nature of JavaScript</a></h3>
<p>These are a few traits of the language:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Its syntax is part of the C family of languages (curly braces, etc.).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a dynamic language: most objects can be changed in various ways at runtime, objects can be created directly, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a dynamically typed language: variables don’t have fixed static types and you can assign any value to a given (mutable) variable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has functional programming features: first-class functions, closures, partial application via <code>bind()</code>, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has object-oriented features: mutable state, objects, inheritance, classes, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It often fails silently: see <span refcheck="#silent-failures-in-js">the next subsection</span> for details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is deployed as source code. But that source code is often <em>minified</em> (rewritten to require less storage). And there are <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-binary-ast">plans for a binary source code format</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JavaScript is part of the web platform – it is the language built into web browsers. But it is also used elsewhere – for example, in Node.js, for server things, and shell scripting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JavaScript engines often optimize less-efficient language mechanisms under the hood. For example, in principle, JavaScript Arrays are dictionaries. But under the hood, engines store Arrays contiguously if they have contiguous indices.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="silent-failures-in-js"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#silent-failures-in-js">4.2.1 JavaScript often fails silently</a></h4>
<p>JavaScript often fails silently. Let’s look at two examples.</p>
<p>First example: If the operands of an operator don’t have the appropriate types, they are converted as necessary.</p>
<pre class="language-node-repl">
<span class="hljs-meta prompt_">&gt;</span> <span class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">'3'</span> * <span class="hljs-string">'5'</span></span>
15
</pre>
<p>Second example: If an arithmetic computation fails, you get an error value, not an exception.</p>
<pre class="language-node-repl">
<span class="hljs-meta prompt_">&gt;</span> <span class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-number">1</span> / <span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>
Infinity
</pre>
<p>The reason for the silent failures is historical: JavaScript did not have exceptions until ECMAScript 3. Since then, its designers have tried to avoid silent failures.</p>
<h3 id="tips-for-getting-started-with-javascript"><a class="heading-id-link" href="#tips-for-getting-started-with-javascript">4.3 Tips for getting started with JavaScript</a></h3>
<p>These are a few tips to help you get started with JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Take your time to really get to know this language. The conventional C-style syntax hides that this is a very unconventional language. Learn especially the quirks and the rationales behind them. Then you will understand and appreciate the language better.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In addition to details, this book also teaches simple rules of thumb to be safe – for example, “Always use <code>===</code> to determine if two values are equal, never <code>==</code>.”
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language tools make it easier to work with JavaScript. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can statically type JavaScript via <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can check for problems and anti-patterns via linters such as <a href="https://eslint.org">ESLint</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can format your code automatically via code formatters such as <a href="https://prettier.io">Prettier</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        For more information on JavaScript tooling, see <a href="ch_next-steps.html#ch_next-steps">“Next steps: overview of web development” (§49)</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get in contact with the community:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Social media services such as Mastodon are popular among JavaScript programmers. As a mode of communication that sits between the spoken and the written word, it is well suited for exchanging knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many cities have regular free meetups where people come together to learn topics related to JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript conferences are another convenient way of meeting other JavaScript programmers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read books and blogs. Much material is free online!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
